          Dear Avanti ❤️

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
We met on a train on 25th December — a day that was supposed to be
ordinary, but turned into the beginning of something magical.
<br /><br />

At first, when I saw you, I honestly thought you were a little rude.
And when I saw your dad, I won’t lie… I was a bit scared too.
But then something changed.
<br /><br />

We shared tea together, then biryani, and even cold drinks.
I still remember how I kept throwing all the waste so you wouldn’t have to.
We played bottle flip, then Ludo,
and you kept holding my hand again and again without even realizing it.
<br /><br />

Baby, I don’t even know how those 19 hours passed.
You fell asleep too, remember?
And somewhere in between all of that,
I started feeling something I had never planned.
<br /><br />

I thought maybe after that day, we would never meet again.
That’s why I wanted to spend every possible moment with you.
I came to drop you, but honestly…
my heart didn’t want to go away from you at all.
Maybe that was the very first step of falling in love.
<br /><br />

Our first date on 29th December felt like I had known you forever.
Every smile, every word, every silence felt right.
<br /><br />

And then came 14th January — the day you said yes,
the day you said “love you more,”
and unknowingly made me the happiest person alive.
<br /><br />

After that came 23rd January — the day you were coming to meet me.
Honestly, I can never forget that day.
I was so tense the entire time, wondering if you were okay,
if you would arrive safely.
I know I irritated you a lot that day,
but baby, until I saw you with my own eyes,
my heart just wouldn’t calm down.
<br /><br />

When there were delays — with the flight, with the luggage —
it felt like my chest would explode.
I swear, it felt like I might get an attack.
And then you finally arrived…
that moment, that relief — uff.
Baby, I can’t even explain it.
I really, truly love you.
<br /><br />

And then came 26th January — the day you had to leave.
I hugged you three times because my heart just wasn’t ready to let you go.
I didn’t want you to leave at all,
but I knew some things aren’t in our control.
When I came back, I cried a lot.
I missed you terribly,
and that incomplete letter you wrote for me —
I still miss it, and I still miss you every single day.
<br /><br />

I know I can be a little over-caring,
sometimes a little possessive,
and yes, I get upset at times.
It hurts me when I hear about other guys,
not because I don’t trust you,
but because I care too deeply.
<br /><br />

But one thing I want you to know —
I will always stand by you.
I will always support you,
protect your heart,
and love you the same way, always.
And don’t worry…
I promise I will never hurt you.
Trust me.

Avanti, this journey with you is my favorite story.
I don’t know where life will take us, but I know one thing —
I want to walk every path with you.
